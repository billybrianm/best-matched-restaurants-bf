# Best Matched Restaurants
This application is an API with functionality to search for restaurants based on specific criteria.

## Assumptions
- This project was created as a REST API since where were no restrictions and I wanted to create a fully fledged system with backend and frontend communications
- No security is necessary for the scope of this project
- No need for bootstrap or docker setups
